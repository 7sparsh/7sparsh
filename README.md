<h2>### Hi there 👋</h2>

<h4>I am Sparsh Saxena, a junior year student who is pursuing Information Technology in IEM Kolkata. I stumbled upon the field of Web Dev when I was a sophomore and since then I have been  trying to learn new stuff and build something out of them. Alongside, building projects I solve algorithmic challenges and am trying to improve in the same. I spend my free time reading and playing games.</h4>
